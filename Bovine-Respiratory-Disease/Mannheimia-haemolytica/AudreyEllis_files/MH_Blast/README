This directory contains the scripts used to create a BLAST database (Slurm-MHBlastDB) using specific genes (gyrA and parC) and then BLAST the sequences (Slurm-MHBlastSeqs) using the newly created database. Once this was done the results of the blast were copied into one file (MH_Genes). These genes could then be downloaded locally and put in a multiple sequence alignment viewer such as Jalview. 

Mh_RefGenes.txt are the genes used to create the database for the study "Phenotypic antibiotic resistance prediction in Mannheimia haemolytica isolates from cattle with bovine respiratory disease using resistance gene databases and machine learning models."

Isolates used in this study can be found in BioProject PRJNA1115110 and BioProject PRJNA306895 (these isolates are from the study completed by Owen et al. 2017 https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.117.1137)
